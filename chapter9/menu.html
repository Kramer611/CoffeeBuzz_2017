<!-- META DESCRIPTION 
The meta description tag exists as a short description of a page's content. Search engines do not use the keywords or phrases in this tag for rankings, but meta descriptions are the primary source for the snippet of text displayed beneath a listing in the results.

Meta descriptions can be any length, but search engines generally will cut snippets longer than 160 characters, so it's generally wise to stay within in these limits.

<!-- mwilliams:  Added for Responsive Design:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

	- Use the meta viewport tag to control the width and scaling of the browser's viewport.
	- Include width=device-width to match the screen's width in device-independent pixels.
	- Include initial-scale=1 to establish a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels.
	- Ensure your page is accessible by not disabling user scaling 
	  maximum-scale=1 would disable scaling.
	  
	  Note:  Not all mobile browsers handle orientation changes in the same way. For example, Mobile Safari often just zooms the page when changing from portrait to landscape, instead of laying out the page as it would if originally loaded in landscape. If web developers want their scale settings to remain consistent when switching orientations on the iPhone, they must add a maximum-scale value to prevent this zooming, which has the sometimes-unwanted side effect of preventing users from zooming in:

<!-- Title Tag 
	- Is meant to be an accurate, concise description of a page's content
	- Important part of search engine optimization:  create descriptive, keyword-laden (laden->heavily loaded) title tags for search engine ranking
	- keep your titles under 60 characters
